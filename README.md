# Countdown Timer

Build a countdown timer in Python that starts from a number entered by the user and 
counts down to 1 with a 1-second delay between each number. When the countdown finishes, 
the program displays a final message chosen by the user.

This project is a great way to practice loops, time delays, user input, and input validation.
